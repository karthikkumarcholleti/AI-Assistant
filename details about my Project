**Stock Market AI Assistant**
This project is an AI-powered assistant designed to handle a wide variety of stock-related queries. It can provide real-time stock price information, perform trend analysis, compare stock prices, and provide stock-related news sentiment. The assistant is built using BERT for intent detection, combined with FinGPT for real-time data fetching, and is integrated with APIs like yfinance to retrieve stock data.

**Features** 
1. Stock Price Inquiry
The assistant can fetch the current, high, low, open, and close prices of stocks for specific timeframes (e.g., today, yesterday, last week, etc.).
Paraphrased or flexible queries like "How much did Tesla peak at today?" and "What’s the current value of Apple?" are supported.
2. Stock Trend Analysis
Users can ask for stock trends, such as "How has Microsoft been trending this month?" or "What was Tesla’s performance last week?"
The model detects trends for periods like this week, last week, and more complex natural expressions (e.g., "this year" or "past three months").
3. Stock Comparison
The assistant compares multiple stocks over specified periods. For example, "Compare the current price of Tesla and Apple" or "Show me the trend comparison between Google and Amazon last month."
4. News Sentiment Analysis
Retrieves and analyzes the sentiment of stock-related news articles. Users can ask, "What is the sentiment of Facebook news today?"

FinGPT: Used for real-time query handling and response generation for stock prices and trends.
yfinance API: Fetches real-time and historical stock data, including various price types (open, close, high, low) and trend data over custom time periods (e.g., 1D, 1W, 1M, 1Y).
